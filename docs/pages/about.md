# **About Me**

Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:,<br>
I have learned data structure with C#, C++ and Java at University of Texas at San Antonio. I also self taught web and android development so, I am eager to assist in front and back-end development and apply my knowledge towards my future job.
